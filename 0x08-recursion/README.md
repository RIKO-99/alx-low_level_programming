RECURSION PROJECTS ALX SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 

Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.


1. function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: puts. Run man puts to learn more.

2. function that prints a string in reverse.

Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);
