Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.
Based on the type of search operation, these algorithms are generally classified into two categories:
### 1. sequential Search
In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. For example: Linear Search.

### 2. Interval Search
These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than Linear Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. For Example: Binary Search.

In this project we explore diffrent implementation of seearch algorithms from linear, binary, jump, interpolation, exponatiol exetra.
Files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
Code should be Betty style compliant. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
