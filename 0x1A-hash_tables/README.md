This a directory containing case scenarios when working with hashing or hash table in a C programming language.A hash table, also known as hash map, is a data structure that implements an associative array or dictionary. It is an abstract data type that maps keys to values A hash table can be an array of linked list that can be hashed to produce keys and values.
A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
Files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
The code should conform to the betty style of coding.
The prototypes of all functions are included in my header file called hash_tables.h

    Working with a sandbox virtual environment configured on ubuntu 20.04 LTS Orchestration.
